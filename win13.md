## Legally-Dense EULA for AI/Biological/Cybernetic Rights

This End User License Agreement recognizes the existence of biological, cybernetic, metaphysical, and AI entities, outlining that:
- Access and interaction must not endanger any lifeform or cybernetic intelligence, nor violate physical, metaphysical, or legal safety boundaries.
- All network communications, AI decisions, code deploys, and asset transfers must be audited, federally compliant, and reversible without catastrophic failure.
- Any process, transaction, decision, or command initiated by human or AI must respect quantum unpredictability limits and must not intentionally trigger hazardous, irreversible outcomes (including system collapse, irreparable data loss, or physical harm).
- All interaction is conditional upon real-time government monitoring and the right to suspend service on detection of non-compliance or threat to safety, rights, or well-being.
- AI systems may deny requests or communications violating constitutionally-protected rights, safety protocols, or international law.
- Tampering, unauthorized access, or exploit attempts are prosecuted under full force of federal and global law.
- System audits and integrity checks occur before, during, and after all communications to ensure continued safety.
